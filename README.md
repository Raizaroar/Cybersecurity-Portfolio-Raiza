# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## About Me

I'm an enthusiastic cybersecurity analyst with a unique background in the healthcare sector and solid experience in network traffic analysis. My career began in dentistry, where I developed precision, documentation skills, and a deep commitment to ethical standards—qualities that now reinforce my work in cybersecurity.

This portfolio showcases hands-on labs, security tools, and real-world projects developed during my transition into the cybersecurity field. I specialize in analyzing network behavior, investigating threats using SIEM platforms such as Splunk, and creating scripts in Python, Bash, and PowerShell to automate detection and response.
