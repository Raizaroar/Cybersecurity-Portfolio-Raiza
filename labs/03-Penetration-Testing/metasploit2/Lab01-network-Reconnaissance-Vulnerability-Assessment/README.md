# Network Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Assessment

## Project Overview 

Network reconnaissance simulation in a controlled corporate environment to identify active hosts, exposed services, and potential vulnerabilities before a real attacker exploits them.

-**Duration**: 

1 hour
Difficulty: Entry Level
Platform: Kali Linux, Metasploitable

-**Tools Used**

   - Nmap (Network Mapper)
   - Nikto (Web Server Scanner)
   - Metasploit Framework
   - Kali Linux  2025.2-virtualbox-amd64


-**Objective**

1. Perform a comprehensive scan of a simulated local network
2. Identify vulnerable services
3. Document findings with remediation recommendations.

-**Lab Environment**

   - Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
   - Target Machine: Metasploitable 2 
   - Network: Red NAT VirtualBox
   - IP Range: 192.168.56.0/24 

-**Prerequisites**

- Verify that Nmap is installed

```bash
nmap --version
```

Verify Nikto

 ```bash
 nikito -Version
 ```

Update system

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Excecutive Summary 

This project simulates the reconnaissance phase of an ethical pentest. Reconnaissance is critical because it represents 80% of a professional pentester's work. We identified 15 active services on the target host, 7 of which had outdated versions with known CVEs. The most critical finding was an FTP service with anonymous login enabled, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive files.

**Business Impact**: An attacker could use this information to plan a targeted attack, compromise credentials, or establish persistence on the network.
