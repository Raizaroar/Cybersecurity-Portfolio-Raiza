# Network Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Assessment

## Project Overview 

Network reconnaissance simulation in a controlled corporate environment to identify active hosts, exposed services, and potential vulnerabilities before a real attacker exploits them.

-**Duration**: 

1 hour
Difficulty: Entry Level
Platform: Kali Linux, Metasploitable

-**Tools Used**

   - Nmap 7.95
   - Nikto 2.5.0
   - Metasploit Framework
   - Kali Linux  2025.2-virtualbox-amd64


-**Objective**

1. Perform a comprehensive scan of a simulated local network
2. Identify vulnerable services
3. Document findings with remediation recommendations.

-**Lab Environment**

   - Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
   - Target Machine: Metasploitable 2 
   - Network: Red NAT VirtualBox
   - IP Range: 192.168.56.0/24 

-**Prerequisites**

- Verify that Nmap is installed

```bash
nmap --version
```

Verify Nikto

 ```bash
 nikito -Version
 ```

Update system

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Excecutive Summary 

This project simulates the reconnaissance phase of an ethical pentest. Reconnaissance is critical because it represents 80% of a professional pentester's work. I identified 15 active services on the target host, 7 of which had outdated versions with known CVEs. The most critical finding was an FTP service with anonymous login enabled, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive files.

**Business Impact**: An attacker could use this information to plan a targeted attack, compromise credentials, or establish persistence on the network.

## Step-by-Step Exceution 

- **Configured Red NAT both VM**

- **Verify connectivity**

Before starting the pentest, I needeed to make sure that Kali can conect with Metasploitable.

```bash 
ping 10.0.2.4
```

## Phase 1: Host Discovery 

**Objective:** Find out which machines are “alive” on the network.

***Command Ping Sweep***

```bash
sudo nmap -sn 10.0.2.5/24
```

> [!NOTE]
> `-sn` | “Scan - No port scan” | Only asks “are you there?” without scanning ports (faster)
> Host Active = 3

***Why don't I use other commands?***

Alternative 1: fping -a -g 192.168.56.0/24

 - Faster, but provides less information

 - Not the industry standard for reporting

Alternative 2: Manually scan each IP with ping

 - It would take 30 minutes to scan 256 IPs

 -  Prone to human error

Nmap -sn ***is perfect** because:

- Fast (2 seconds)

- Professional standard

- Provides useful information (MAC address, latency)

## Phase 2: Port Scanning

**Objective:** Discover which services are open in Metasploitable.





**Command breakdown:**


| Parte | ¿Qué hace? | Explicación detallada |
|-------|------------|----------------------|
| `sudo` | Permisos admin | Igual que antes |
| `nmap` | El programa | El escáner |
| `-p-` | Escanea TODOS los puertos | El guión después de `-p` significa "del 1 al 65535" |
| `-T4` | Velocidad agresiva | T0=paranoid, T1=sneaky, T2=polite, T3=normal, **T4=aggressive**, T5=insane |
| `-A` | "Aggressive scan" | Detecta: OS, versiones de servicios, scripts, traceroute (TODO) |
| `192.168.56.101` | IP objetivo | Nuestra Metasploitable |
