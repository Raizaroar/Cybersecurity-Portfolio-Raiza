#  Local Network Vulnerability Detection and Scanning

## Project Overview

This lab simulates the initial phase of a penetration test: reconnaissance. You will learn how to identify devices on a network, map active services, and detect known vulnerabilities, all documented in a professional manner.

    - Objective

- Perform a local network scan to identify active hosts.
- Enumerate services and software versions.
- Detect potential vulnerabilities using Nmap and Nikto.
- Document findings in a professional format.

    - Lab Environment

- Attacker: Kali Linux 
- Target: Metasploitable 2 (vulnerable VM for legal practice)
- Network: Bridge or NAT mode configuration
- Tools: Nmap, Nikto, Dirb
