## Project Overview

Comprehensive training in phishing email analysis, covering email header inspection, sender authentication verification (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), malicious link/attachment identification, and IOC extraction. Phishing is the #1 attack vector globally (90% of breaches start with phishing), making this skill essential for all SOC analysts.

**Real-World Relevance:**  
Every SOC analyst receives daily reports of suspicious emails. This lab teaches the EXACT workflow used in production environments to triage, analyze, and respond to potential phishing threats.
