# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental network traffic analysis skills using Wireshark. The analysis focuses on identifying common protocols, understanding packet structures, and detecting potential security issues in captured network traffic.

Duration: 2-3 hours
Difficulty: Entry Level
Platform: Kali Linux 2024.x

Tools Used:

- Wireshark (GUI analysis)
- tcpdump (packet capture)
- tshark (CLI analysis)
- capinfos (statistics)
- Linux command line utilities

Objectives

1. Capture live network traffic using Wireshark
2. Analyze common protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP, ICMP)
3. Identify normal vs suspicious network behavior
4. Extract relevant information from packet captures
5. Document findings in a professional format

Lab Environment
