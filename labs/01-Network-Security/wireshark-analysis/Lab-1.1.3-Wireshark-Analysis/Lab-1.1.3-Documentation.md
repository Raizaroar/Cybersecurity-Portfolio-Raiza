# PROJECT OVERVIEW

In this lab, you will learn how to use Wireshark, the #1 network traffic analysis tool in cybersecurity. You will capture packets in real time, analyze network protocols, and detect malicious activities such as port scanning, ARP spoofing, and suspicious communications.
Real-world scenario:
You are a SOC Analyst, and the IDS (Intrusion Detection System) has alerted you to abnormal traffic on the network. Your mission: capture the traffic, analyze the packets, identify the nature of the activity, and determine whether it is:

- An active attack (port scanning, reconnaissance)
- Legitimate but unusual traffic
- Normal business activity
