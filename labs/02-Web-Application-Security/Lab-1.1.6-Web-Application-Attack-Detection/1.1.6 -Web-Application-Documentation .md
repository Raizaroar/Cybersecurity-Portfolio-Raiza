## Project Overview

In this lab, I'll learn how to identify common attacks against web applications by analyzing web server logs (Apache, Nginx). I'll detect SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), path traversal, and other attacks from the OWASP Top 10. This skill is critical because web applications are the #1 target of attackers.

**Real-world scenario:**

I'm a SOC Analyst, and the development team reports suspicious activity on the corporate web application. The WAF (Web Application Firewall) is generating alerts. 

My job is to:

- Analyze web server logs.
- Identify attack patterns.
- Determine if there was a successful compromise.
- Extract IOCs (attacking IPs, malicious URLs).
- Recommend mitigation.
